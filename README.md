# server-core-switch-lab
Simulated enterprise switch replacement lab with VLANs, ACLs, firmware upgrades, rollback planning, and network diagrams.
# üß† Server/Core Switch Replacement Lab

This lab simulates a real-world enterprise network upgrade involving the replacement and configuration of core switches, port migration, ACL deployment, and rollback planning.

---

## üß© Lab Objectives

- Configure and test a simulated core switch using VLANs, ACLs, and STP
- Practice firmware upgrades and rollback scenarios
- Document port mappings and switch-to-router transitions
- Write go/no-go criteria for hardware migration
- Use mock monitoring tools (IPAM, LiveAction) for visibility and diagnostics

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts

- VLANs, ACLs, RSTP, EtherChannel (LACP)
- IOS/JunOS mock CLI commands
- IPAM & SNMP visibility (simulated)
- GitHub for version control & documentation
